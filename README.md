[Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problem solutions.

For compiling the code with G++ compiler use the next command `g++ {source_code_file.cpp} -o {result.exe}`. Then execute it via `./{result.exe} input.txt`.

My sample programs get the input from the file passed as 1st argument.

##Notes

1. Day 3 part 2 requires refactor in getOGR and getCSR functions (only change a condition) (idea pass a anonimous function with the comparision that returns boolean).
2. Day 4 part 2 the sample input gets the correct solution but not the real input. Check why.
